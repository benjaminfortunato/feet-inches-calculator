# Feet & Inches Calculator - Unit Testing Summary

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. Import Error Fixed
- **Problem**: GUI showed error "cannot import name 'run_test' from calculator_engine"
- **Solution**: Fixed syntax error in `calculator_engine.py` (missing newline and incorrect indentation)
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - GUI "Run Tests" button now works correctly

### 2. Comprehensive Unit Test File Created
- **File**: `test_calculator.py`
- **Coverage**: 19 comprehensive test methods
- **Status**: ✅ Complete and fully functional

### 3. Build Process Integration
- **Integration**: Tests now run automatically during build process
- **Behavior**: Build fails if any tests fail, ensuring no broken calculator is built
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented in `build.py`

## 📊 Test Coverage Summary

### Test Categories (19 Total Tests):
1. **Parsing Tests** (7 methods): All measurement format parsing
2. **Arithmetic Tests** (5 methods): Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, negative results
3. **Advanced Math Tests** (2 methods): PEMDAS order of operations, complex expressions
4. **Formatting Tests** (2 methods): Positive and negative result formatting
5. **Edge Cases** (2 methods): Boundary conditions and error validation
6. **Real-World Tests** (1 method): Practical construction scenarios

### Measurement Formats Covered:
- ✅ Feet only (`5'`)
- ✅ Inches only (`11"`)
- ✅ Feet and inches (`5' 11"`)
- ✅ Pure fractions (`1/2"`, `7/8"`)
- ✅ Mixed fractions (`0 1/2"`, `2 3/4"`)
- ✅ Feet with fractions (`5' 7/8"`)
- ✅ Feet with mixed fractions (`5' 11 7/8"`)

### Mathematical Operations Covered:
- ✅ Addition with all formats
- ✅ Subtraction with all formats
- ✅ Multiplication (e.g., `2' * 3`)
- ✅ Division (e.g., `6' / 2`)
- ✅ PEMDAS order of operations
- ✅ Parentheses grouping
- ✅ Complex multi-operation expressions
- ✅ Negative result handling

## 🚀 Usage

### Run Tests Manually:
```bash
python test_calculator.py
```

### Run Tests via GUI:
- Click the "Run Tests" button in the calculator application

### Build with Automatic Testing:
```bash
python build.py
```
- Tests run first
- Build only proceeds if all tests pass
- Build fails immediately if any test fails

## 📁 Files Modified/Created

### Core Files:
- ✅ `calculator_engine.py` - Fixed syntax errors, added `run_tests()` function
- ✅ `test_calculator.py` - Comprehensive unit test suite (19 tests)
- ✅ `build.py` - Integrated automatic test running

### Documentation:
- ✅ `TEST_COVERAGE.md` - Detailed test coverage documentation
